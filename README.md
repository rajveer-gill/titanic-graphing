# titanic-graphing

## Description
The purpose of this code is to try and graph the components of a set of data. This code helps rearrange data and put it into a visiual to make the data easier to analyze. Creating this program helped me to better understand file usage within python and how to create visual aids through the language.

## Features
This code specializes in python. It has 4 main functions within the code to help the program display a graph of the data. The first function gets the data from an outside file and brings it into the program for the code to use. The next function helps break down the information by summarizing key components of the data. The third function gets the values of the means and standard deviations and uses it to calculate the correlations needed for the graph. The final function helps create a final visual of the data.

## How to Use
In order to use the code, download the code through a zip file and open the zip file up. Next, upload the file components to your local compiler.

## Technologies
The system used to create this app was a MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has an 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 16 GB of memory.

## Collaborators
I was able to develop this code through the guidance of the University of Oregon Computer Science and Information division.
